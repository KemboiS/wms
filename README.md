WAREHOUSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

A project to make an intelligent warehouse management system which optimises a warehouse helping in reducing labour costs and space wasted while also increasing efficiency and space. Our project helps keep track of the shipments which come in and out of the warehouse, the highest selling products, the recently added products and also aimed to recommend which shipment of products to order next to increase profits while keeping in mind the space used to store the shipments isn't wasted.
